**Your website must contain at least four different .html pages, and it should be possible to get from any page on your website to any other page by following one or more hyperlinks**

I have four HTML files: Indian, Italian, Mexican and Vietnamese.htmls.


**Your website must include at least one list (ordered or unordered), at least one table, and at least one image**

I have each of these HTML files as an unordered list, I have a table and an image of myself.


**Your website must have at least one stylesheet file**
I have created an external stylesheet and linked this to a scss document.


**Your stylesheet(s) must use at least five different CSS properties, and at least five different types of CSS selectors. You must use the #id selector at least once, and the .class selector at least once.**

- I've used various CSS properties including: padding, border radius, margin, text-shadow, color etc.
- I've used the ID selector to set paragraph as my id="mydescription" and an id="emailmebutton" to my call to action button. I use the ID in the first sentence to set a different background colour to that text.
- I've used the class selector class="errormessage" to display an error message.


**Your stylesheet(s) must include at least one mobile-responsive @media query, such that something about the styling changes for smaller screens.**

I've used an @media query to change the headline text of my webpage from "Welcome to Luke's website!" to "welcome" depending on the screen size.

**You must use Bootstrap 4 on your website, taking advantage of at least one Bootstrap component, and using at least two Bootstrap columns for layout purposes using Bootstrapâ€™s grid model**

- I've imported in bootstrap as an external stylesheet.
- I've used a bootstrap button component and a mailto component that will send me an email.
- I've used two bootstrap columns and added content to each of them.


**Your stylesheets must use at least one SCSS variable, at least one example of SCSS nesting, and at least one use of SCSS inheritance**

- I use many SCSS colour variables (which can be found in styleguide.scss)
- I use SCSS nesting to change the colour of a paragraph that is inside a <div> or not
- I use SCSS inheritance to create two messages in a box at the bottom of the website, where each message inherits most properties but I add a few unique properties to it.
